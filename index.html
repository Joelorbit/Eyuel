        <h3>Beginner Front-End Developer </h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Eyuel Getachew, a beginner front-end developer who is just starting my journey into web development. I have always been fascinated by how websites work and how creative designs come to life through coding. Right now, I'm focusing on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build simple but effective web pages. Though I am still at the early stages, I am eager to improve my skills, take on new challenges, and build real projects that showcase my progress. My goal is to become a skilled front-end developer and eventually explore more advanced web technologies.

        <h1>My portfolio</h1>
        <p>This is my portfolio, where I will be showcasing the projects I build as I continue learning front-end development. Right now, I am practicing by creating small projects like basic web pages, landing pages, and simple interactive elements. Every project I work on helps me understand coding concepts better, and I am excited to see my progress over time. As I gain more experience, I plan to work on more complex websites and improve my design and functionality skills. Feel free to check out my work and share any feedback that could help me improve!

        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>Since I am still in the early stages of learning front-end development, my projects are mainly focused on practicing the fundamentals. Here are some of the small projects I have worked on so far:<br>
           <em style="color: rgb(204, 74, 161);" >Personal Portfolio Website – A simple webpage where I introduce myself and my work.<br>    </em>                                       
           <em style="color:rgb(204, 74, 161);">Basic Landing Page – A clean and responsive web page designed using HTML and CSS.<br></em>
            <em style="color: rgb(204, 74, 161);" >JavaScript To-Do List – A small interactive project that allows users to add and remove tasks.<br></em>
            <em style="color: rgb(204, 74, 161);" >Simple Navigation Bar – A practice project where I learned how to create a responsive menu.<br></em>
             I am constantly looking for new project ideas to expand my skills. As I continue learning, I plan to explore JavaScript frameworks, animations, and more advanced design techniques to enhance my projects.
